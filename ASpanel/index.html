<h1>Japanese tea ceremony (Test page)</h1>
</header><main>
<h2 id="section_1">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <strong>Japanese tea ceremony</strong>, also called the <strong>Way of
Tea</strong>, is a Japanese cultural activity involving the ceremonial
preparation and presentation of <em>matcha</em> (<span lang="ja">抹茶</span>), powdered
green tea. In Japanese, it is called <em>chanoyu</em> (<span lang="ja">茶の湯</span>) or
<em>sadō</em>, <em>chadō</em> (<span lang="ja">茶道</span>). The manner in which it is performed,
or the art of its performance, is called <em>(o)temae</em> (<span lang="ja">[お]手前;
[お]点前</span>). Zen Buddhism was a primary influence in the development of the
Japanese tea ceremony. Much less commonly, Japanese tea ceremony uses leaf tea,
primarily sencha, in which case it is known in Japanese as senchadō
(<span lang="ja">煎茶道</span>, the way of sencha) as opposed to chanoyu or chadō; see sencha tea
ceremony, below.</p>

<p>Tea gatherings are classified as an informal tea gathering chakai (<span lang="ja">茶会</span>,
tea gathering) and a formal tea gathering <em>chaji</em> (<span lang="ja">茶事</span>, tea event). A <em>chakai</em>
is a relatively simple course of hospitality that includes confections, thin
tea, and perhaps a light meal. A <em>chaji</em> is a much more formal gathering, usually
including a full-course <em>kaiseki</em> meal followed by confections, thick tea, and
thin tea. A <em>chaji</em> can last up to four hours.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The first documented evidence of tea in Japan dates to the 9th century, when it was taken by the Buddhist monk Eichū 
(<span lang="ja">永忠</span>) on his return from China. 
The entry in the <i>Nihon Kōki</i> states that Eichū personally prepared and served sencha (unground Japanese green tea) to Emperor Saga who was on an excursion in Karasaki (in present Shiga Prefecture) in the year 815. 
It was practiced by Japanese nobles.
By imperial order in the year 816, tea plantations began to be cultivated in the Kinki region of Japan.
However, the interest in tea in Japan faded after this.</p>

<p>In China, tea had already been known, according to legend, for more than a thousand years. 
The form of tea popular in China in Eichū's time was "cake tea" or "brick tea" (<span lang="ja">団茶</span> <i>dancha</i>)—tea 
compressed into a nugget in the same manner as Pu-erh. This then would be ground in a mortar, and the resulting ground tea mixed together with various other herbs and/or flavourings.</p>

<p>The custom of drinking tea, first for medicinal, and then largely also for pleasurable reasons, was already widespread throughout China.
In the early 9th century, Chinese author Lu Yu wrote <i>The Classic of Tea</i>, 
a treatise on tea focusing on its cultivation and preparation. 
Lu Yu's life had been heavily influenced by Buddhism, particularly the Zen–Chán school. 
His ideas would have a strong influence in the development of the Japanese tea ceremony.</p>

<p>Around the end of the 12th century, the style of tea preparation called "<i>tencha</i>" (<span lang="ja">点茶</span>),
in which powdered <i>matcha</i> was placed into a bowl, hot water added, and the tea and hot water whipped together, 
was introduced to Japan by Eisai, another monk, on his return from China. 
He also took tea seeds back with him, which eventually produced tea that was considered to be the most superb quality in all of Japan.
</p>

<p>This powdered green tea was first used in religious rituals in Buddhist monasteries. 
By the 13th century, when the Kamakura Shogunate ruled the nation and tea and the luxuries associated with it became a kind of status symbol among the warrior class, 
there arose tea-tasting (<span lang="ja">闘茶</span> <i>tōcha</i>) parties wherein contestants could win 
extravagant prizes for guessing the best quality tea—that grown in Kyoto, deriving from the seeds that Eisai brought from China.
</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Many schools of Japanese tea ceremony have evolved through the long history of <i>chadō</i> and are active today.</p>

<h2 id"section_2">Venues</h2>
<p>While a purpose-built tatami-floored room is considered the ideal venue, 
any place where the necessary implements for the making and serving of the tea can be set out and 
where the host can make the tea in the presence of the seated guest(s) can be used as a venue for tea. 
For instance, a tea gathering can be held picnic-style in the outdoors (this is known as <i>nodate</i> (<span lang="ja">野点</span>).
</p>

<p>A purpose-built room designed for the <i>wabi</i> style of tea is called a <i>chashitsu</i>, and is ideally 4.5 tatami in floor area. 
It has a low ceiling; a hearth built into the floor; an alcove for hanging scrolls and placing other decorative objects; 
and separate entrances for host and guests. It also has an attached preparation area known as a mizuya. 
A 4.5-mat room is considered standard, but smaller and larger rooms are also used. 
Building materials and decorations are deliberately simple and rustic in <i>wabi</i> style tea rooms. 
<i>Chashitsu</i> can also refer to free-standing buildings for tea ceremony. 
Known in English as tea houses, such structures may contain several tea rooms of different sizes and styles, 
dressing and waiting rooms, and other amenities, and be surrounded by a tea garden called a <i>roji</i>.
</p>

<h2>Seasons</h2>
<p>Seasonality and the changing of the seasons are important in tea ceremony. 
Traditionally the year is divided by tea practitioners into two main seasons: 
the sunken hearth (<span lang="ja">炉</span> <i>ro</i>) season, constituting the colder months (traditionally November to April), 
and the brazier (<span lang="ja">風炉</span> <i>furo</i>) season, constituting the warmer months (traditionally May to October). 
For each season, there are variations in the temae performed and utensils and other equipment used. 
Ideally, the configuration of the tatami in a 4.5 mat room changes with the season as well.

<h2>Sencha tea ceremony</h2>

<p>Like the formal art surrounding matcha, there is a formal art surrounding sencha, 
which is distinguished as senchadō (<span lang="ja">煎茶道</span>, the way of sencha). 
Generally it involves the high-grade gyokuro class of sencha. 
This ceremony, more Chinese in style, was introduced to Japan in the 17th century by Ingen, 
the founder of the Ōbaku school of Zen Buddhism, which is in general more Chinese in style than earlier schools. 
In the 18th century, it was popularized by the Ōbaku monk Baisao, who sold tea in Kyoto, and later came to be regarded as the first sencha master.
It remains associated with the Ōbaku school, and the head temple of Manpuku-ji hosts regular sencha tea ceremony conventions.
